A watered down version of my first plugin, New Wand.

I have personally was looking around for a custom WorldEdit wand "wrapper" of sorts a few months back.  
There wasn't one then so I decided to make my own.  Everything (mostly) is configurable inside including 
but not limited to, wand lore, display name, item used, plugin prefix.

It also includes a visual to see where you are selecting.  A fake block is placed on the locations of the 
right and left click of the selection, which too can be configured to your liking.

Permissions
  newerwand.use: Player can use commands (/nw help and /nw) and wands.
  newerwand.admin: Can reload the plugin.

Commands
/NW: Gives the player a wand.
/NW Help:  Bring up help menu.
/NW Reload: Reload the plugin configs.
/NW About: Gives a little info on the creator.
