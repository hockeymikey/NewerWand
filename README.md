A watered down version of my first plugin, New Wand.

I have personally was looking around for a custom WorldEdit wand "wrapper" of sorts a few months back.  
There wasn't one then so I decided to make my own.  Everything (mostly) is configurable inside including 
but not limited to, wand lore, display name, item used, plugin prefix.

It also includes a visual to see where you are selecting.  A fake block is placed on the locations of the 
right and left click of the selection, which too can be configured to your liking.
